### Heat and Work
 - Heat (Q) is the spontaneous flow of energy due to temperature differences.  
Mechanisms:
 - Conduction is by molecular contact
 - Radiation is by emission of electromagnetic waves
 - Convection is the bulk motion of a gas or liquid  
Work (W) is any other transfer of energy.  
 - We do work by pushing a piston, stirring a cup, running current through a  
resistor.  
 - In these cases the internal energy of these systems will increase, and they  
will usually ‘get hotter’, but we don’t call this heat.  
Both descriptions of energy transfers, not total energies in a system.

The overall change in the Internal Energy of a system is
$$\Delta U = Q + W$$
This is a statement of energy conservation. First law of thermodynamics.

### Statements of 1st Law
Isothermal: $\Delta T = 0 \implies \Delta U = 0$
Adiabatic: $Q = 0$


### Heat
The flow of energy due to temperature differential.
Mechanisms
 - Conduction: Molecular contact
 - Convection: Bulk motion of gas or liquid
 - Radiation: Emission of EM waves
