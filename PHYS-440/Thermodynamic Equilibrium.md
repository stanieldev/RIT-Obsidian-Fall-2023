#TODO: [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium")


Types of Equilibrium
 - Energy Exchange $\rightarrow$ Thermal Equilibrium (Temperature)
 - Volume Exchange $\rightarrow$ Mechanical Equilibrium (Pressure)
 - Particle Exchange $\rightarrow$ Diffusive Equilibrium (Chemical Potential)

### Kinds of Equilibrium
 - Energy exchange (Thermal)
 - Volume exchange (Mechanical)
 - Particle exchange (Diffusive)

Two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium if they are linked by a wall permeable only to heat, and they do not change over time.



The below are obtained from the [[Thermodynamic Identity]]
### Thermal
$$\dfrac{1}{T} = \left(\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial U}\right)_{V,N}$$
### Mechanical
$$\dfrac{1}{T} = \left(\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{U,N}$$
### Diffusive
$$\dfrac{1}{T} = -\left(\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial N}\right)_{U,V}$$
