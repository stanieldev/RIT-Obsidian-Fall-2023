#TODO: Complete [**Microstates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate_(statistical_mechanics)

Why are irreversible macroscopic states are overwhelmingly probable?
 - Microstates described by specific configurations of the system with definite values of physical properties (position, momentum, energy of individual particles) of constituents.

### Multiplicity
$$\Omega = \dfrac{N!}{n_1!n_2!n_3!...} = \dfrac{N!}{\prod_i n_i!}$$
### State Entropy
$$S \equiv k_b \log \Omega$$

### Sterling Approximation
$$N! = N^N e^{-N} \sqrt{2\pi N}$$

### Connection to 2nd Law
Systems tend to evolve towards macrostates with the largest multiplicity.
