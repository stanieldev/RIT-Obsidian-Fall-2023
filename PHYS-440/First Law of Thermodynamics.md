The [**first law of thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics "First law of thermodynamics") is one of the four principal [[Laws of Thermodynamics\|laws of thermodynamics]].
It is a statement of the law of [[Conservation of Energy\|conservation of energy]] in the context of [[Thermodynamic Processes\|thermodynamic processes]].
#### Definition
$$ \Delta U = Q + W $$
 - $\Delta U$ is the change in [[Internal Energy\|internal energy]] of a system.
 - $Q$ is the [[Heat\|heat]] added or removed from a system.
 - $W$ is the [[Thermodynamic Work\|thermodynamic work]] done on or by the system.

### Fundamental Relations
$$\begin{align}
dU &= T dS - P dV + \Sigma_i \mu_iN_i \\
dH &= T dS + V dP \\
dF &= -SdT - PdV \\
dG &= -SdT + V dP
\end{align}$$https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_thermodynamic_relation
