The [**first law of thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics "First law of thermodynamics") is one of the four principal [[Thermodynamic Laws|laws of thermodynamics]].
It is a statement of the law of [[conservation of energy]] in the context of [[thermodynamic processes]].

#### Definition
$$ U = Q + W $$
 - $U$ is the [[internal energy]] of a system.
 - $Q$ is the [[heat]] added or removed from a system.
 - $W$ is the [[thermodynamic work]] done on or by the system.

### [[Thermodynamic Identity]]
The differential of the [[internal energy]] can be expressed as:
$$dU = T dS - PdV + \mu dN$$
 - $dQ \equiv TdS$  : [[Heat\|Entropic energy]]
 - $dW \equiv PdV$ : [[Thermodynamic Work\|Work]], work done by change of volume
 - $dC \equiv \mu dN$  : Energy with gaining particles
