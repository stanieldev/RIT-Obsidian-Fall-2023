It is a statement of the law of [[Conservation of Energy\|conservation of energy]] in the context of [[PHYS-440/Thermodynamic Processes|thermodynamic processes]].

#### Definition

 - $U$ is the [[Internal Energy\|internal energy]] of a system.
 - $Q$ is the [[Heat\|heat]] added or removed from a system.
 - $W$ is the [[Thermodynamic Work\|thermodynamic work]] done on or by the system.
