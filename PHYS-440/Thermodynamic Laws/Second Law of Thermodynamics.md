The [**second law of thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics "Second law of thermodynamics") is one of the four principal [[Thermodynamic Laws|laws of thermodynamics]] based on universal experience. It states that [[Heat\|heat]] always flows from regions of higher [[Temperature\|temperature]] to lower [[Temperature\|temperature]] through the methods of [[Thermal Equilibrium\|equilibrium]].
A consequence of the 2nd Law is that it picks a direction for the arrow of time.
