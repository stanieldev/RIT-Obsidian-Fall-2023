The [**second law of thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics "Second law of thermodynamics") is one of the four principal [[Thermodynamic Laws|laws of thermodynamics]] based on universal experience. It states that [[heat]] always flows from regions of higher [[temperature]] to lower [[temperature]] through the methods of [[Thermodynamic Equilibrium\|equilibrium]].
A consequence of the second law is that it picks a direction for the arrow of time.
