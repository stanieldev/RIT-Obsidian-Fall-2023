#TODO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_law_of_thermodynamics, Use 0th law as a template

The [**zeroth law of thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics "Zeroth law of thermodynamics") is one of the four principal [[Thermodynamic Laws|laws of thermodynamics]].
It provides an independent definition of [[Temperature|temperature]] without reference to [[Entropy|entropy]].
### Definition





The Kelvin scale is based on fixing T of the triple point for water  
(T = 273.16 K and P = 611.73 Pa, where water can coexist in the solid,  
liquid, and gas phases in equilibrium)
