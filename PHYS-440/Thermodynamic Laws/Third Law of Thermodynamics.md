The [**third law of thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_law_of_thermodynamics) is one of the four principal [[Thermodynamic Laws|laws of thermodynamics]].
It states that the [[entropy]] of a [[closed system]] at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] approaches a constant value when its temperature approaches [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero").
At absolute zero (zero [[Kelvin (Unit)\|Kelvin]]) the system must be in a state with the minimum possible energy.

### Definition
The Kelvin scale is based on the triple point for water at $T = 273.16 \ \text{K}$ and $P = 611.73 \ \text{Pa}$, a point where water can coexist in solid, liquid, and gas phases at [[Thermodynamic Equilibrium\|equilibrium]].
$$\lim_{\Omega\rightarrow1} (S - S_0) = \lim_{\Omega\rightarrow1} k_b \ln\Omega = k_b\ln1 = 0$$
