The [**zeroth law of thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics "Zeroth law of thermodynamics") is one of the four principal [[Thermodynamic Laws|laws of thermodynamics]].
It provides an independent definition of [[Temperature|temperature]] without reference to [[Entropy|entropy]].
### Definition
 | 
----- | -----
**If** | Two [[Thermodynamic Systems\|thermodynamic systems]] are in [[Thermal Equilibrium\|thermal equilibrium]] with each other
**And** | Are both separately in [[Thermal Equilibrium\|thermal equilibrium]] with a third system 
**Then** | The three systems are in [[Thermal Equilibrium\|thermal equilibrium]] with each other
