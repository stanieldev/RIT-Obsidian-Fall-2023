### Relationship between Temperature and Energy
 - Ideal Gas (no interactions other than elastic collision with wall) is an approximation.
 - Low-density gases are nearly ideal, and turn out to satisfy (experimentally observed) $PV = Nk_B T$
 - We can derive the relationship between Temperature (T) and Kinetic Energy (KE)
$$ \dfrac{3}{2}k_b T = \dfrac{1}{2}m v^2_{rms}$$


### Equipartition of Energy
For a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]] with $N$ particles, each with $f$ degrees of freedom, then the [[Internal Energy\|internal energy]] of the system is $U_{thermal} = \dfrac{f}{2} N k_b T = \dfrac{f}{2}PV$.



$$dG = -SdT + VdP + \mu dN$$


$$C_P = C_V + Nk_b = \left(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P $$
### Enthalpy
$$H \equiv U + PV$$

#TODO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy

Objects at higher [[Temperature\|temperature]] spontaneously gives up [[Heat\|heat]] to objects at lower [[Temperature\|temperature]] through the methods of [[Thermal Equilibrium\|equilibrium]].
