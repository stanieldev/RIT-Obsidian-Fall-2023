In [[Thermodynamics\|thermodynamics]], [**enthalpy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy) is a thermodynamic potential defined as the sum of a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|thermodynamic system]]'s [[Internal Energy\|internal energy]] and the [[Thermodynamic Work\|thermodynamic work]].

### Definition
$$H = U + W_{\text{other}}$$
 - $U$ is the [[Internal Energy\|internal energy]].
 - $W$ is the [[Thermodynamic Work\|thermodynamic work]].
