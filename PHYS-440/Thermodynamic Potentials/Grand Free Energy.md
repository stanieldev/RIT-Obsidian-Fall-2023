In [[Statistical Mechanics\|statistical mechanics]], [**Landau free energy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_potential) is a thermodynamic potential that is used to encapsulate all free energies under one definition.

### Definition
$$\Phi = U - TS - \Sigma_i\mu_iN_i$$
 - $U$ is the [[Internal Energy\|internal energy]].
 - $T$ is the [[Temperature\|temperature]].
 - S is the [[Entropy\|entropy]].
 - $\mu$ is the chemical potential.
 - $N$ is the number of particles in the system.
