### Relationship between Temperature and Energy
 - Ideal Gas (no interactions other than elastic collision with wall) is an approximation.
 - Low-density gases are nearly ideal, and turn out to satisfy (experimentally observed) $PV = Nk_B T$
 - We can derive the relationship between Temperature (T) and Kinetic Energy (KE)
$$ \dfrac{3}{2}k_b T = \dfrac{1}{2}m v^2_{rms}$$
