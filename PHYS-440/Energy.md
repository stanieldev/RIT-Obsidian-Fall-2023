### What is Temperature?
 - ~~The Feeling of warmth~~
 - An [[Intrinsic Property\|intrinsic property]] of 2 systems that are in [[Thermal Equilibrium\|thermal equilibrium]].
 - Energy is exchanged in order to establish [[Thermal Equilibrium\|thermal equilibrium]].
 - Objects at higher temperatures spontaneously give up heat to objects at lower temperatures.
### Kinds of Equilibrium
 - Energy exchange (Thermal)
 - Volume exchange (Mechanical)
 - Particle exchange (Diffusive)
### Ideal Gas Law
$PV = N k_b T$
### Heat
The flow of energy due to temperature differential.
Mechanisms
 - Conduction: Molecular contact
 - Convection: Bulk motion of gas or liquid
 - Radiation: Emission of EM waves
### Internal Energy
$\Delta U = Q + W$, a statement of the First Law of Thermodynamics.

### Work: Compression/Expansion
Recall: $dW = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{dx}$
$\Delta W = P A \Delta x = -P \Delta V$
$W = -\displaystyle\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P dV$
