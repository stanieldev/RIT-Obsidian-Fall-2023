In a [closed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system#Closed_system), no mass may be transferred in or out of the system boundaries. 
The system always contains the same amount of matter, but (sensible) heat and (boundary) work can be exchanged across the boundary of the system.

Whether a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]] can exchange [[Heat\|heat]], [[Thermodynamic Work\|work]], or both is dependent on the property of its boundary.
 - Adiabatic boundary – Not allowing any [[Heat\|heat]] exchange: A [thermally isolated system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermally_isolated_system "Thermally isolated system")
 - Rigid boundary – Not allowing exchange of [[Thermodynamic Work\|work]]: A [mechanically isolated system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanically_isolated_system)
