[**Thermodynamics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics) is a branch of physics that deals with [[Heat\|heat]], [[Thermodynamic Work\|work]], and [[Temperature\|temperature]], and their relation to [[Thermodynamic Potentials\|energy]], [[entropy]], and the physical properties of matter and radiation.

The behavior of these [[Thermodynamic Quantities\|quantities]] is governed by the four [[Thermodynamic Laws\|laws of thermodynamics]] which convey a description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents using [[Statistical Mechanics\|statistical mechanics]].
