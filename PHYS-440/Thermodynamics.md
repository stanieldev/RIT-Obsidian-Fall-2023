### Thermodynamics:
 - Deals with Temperature, Heat, Work, Entropy, Energy, etc, as rather abstract macroscopic concepts obeying certain rules or ‘laws’.
 - It works, but it’s hard to explain why without appealing to Statistical Mechanics.
### [[Laws of Thermodynamics]]
 - 0th Law: [[Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics|Concept of Temperature]]
 - 1st Law: [[First Law of Thermodynamics|Energy Conservation]]
 - 2nd Law: [[Second Law of Thermodynamics|Concept of Entropy]]
 - 3rd Law: [[Third Law of Thermodynamics|Absolute Zero Temperature]]


T dS = dQ
$$dU = T dS - P dV + \mu dN$$
$$\dfrac{1}{T} = \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial U}_{V,N}, \dfrac{P}{T} = \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial V}_{U,N}, \dfrac{\mu}{T} = \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial U}_{U,V}$$
