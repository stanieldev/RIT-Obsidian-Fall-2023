### Thermodynamics:
 - Deals with [[Temperature\|temperature]], [[Heat\|heat]], [[Thermodynamic Work\|work]], [[Entropy\|entropy]], energy, etc, as rather abstract macroscopic concepts obeying certain rules or 'laws'.
 - It works, but itâ€™s hard to explain why without appealing to [[Statistical Mechanics]].
### [[Thermodynamic Laws]]
 - 0th Law: [[Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics|Concept of Temperature]]
 - 1st Law: [[First Law of Thermodynamics|Energy Conservation]]
 - 2nd Law: [[Second Law of Thermodynamics|Concept of Entropy]]
 - 3rd Law: [[Third Law of Thermodynamics|Absolute Zero Temperature]]
