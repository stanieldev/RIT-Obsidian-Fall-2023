### Thermodynamics:
 - Deals with Temperature, Heat, Work, Entropy, Energy, etc, as rather abstract macroscopic concepts obeying certain rules or ‘laws’.
 - It works, but it’s hard to explain why without appealing to Statistical Mechanics.
### Laws of Thermodynamics
 - 0th Law: [[Concept of Temperature]]
 - 1st Law: [[Energy Conservation]]
 - 2nd Law: [[Concept of Entropy]]
 - 3rd Law: [[Absolute Zero Temperature]]
