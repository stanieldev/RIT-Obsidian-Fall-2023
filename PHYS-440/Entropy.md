TODO: [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy")
### Entropy
 - On a microscopic level, laws of Physics are time-invariant, i.e. reversible
 - What about macroscopic phenomena? Are these reversible?
 - How/why can we obtain an irreversible process from the combined effects of very many reversible processes?
 - Because irreversible macroscopic states are overwhelmingly probable.


### Entropy of ideal gas
$$S(U,V,N) = N k_b \log \left[\dfrac{5}{2} + \log \dfrac{V}{N} + \dfrac{3}{2}\log\left(\dfrac{4\pi m (\tfrac{U}{N})}{3\hbar^2}\right)\right]$$
