#TODO: [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy")
### Entropy
 - On a microscopic level, laws of Physics are time-invariant, i.e. reversible
 - What about macroscopic phenomena? Are these reversible?
 - How/why can we obtain an irreversible process from the combined effects of very many reversible processes?
 - Because irreversible macroscopic states are overwhelmingly probable.

$$S \equiv k_b \ln \Omega$$
$$\Omega = \Omega_A \Omega_B \implies S = S_A + S_B$$
