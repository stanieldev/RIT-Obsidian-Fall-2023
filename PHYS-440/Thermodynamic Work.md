**Thermodynamic work** is one of the principal processes by which a [thermodynamic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system "Thermodynamic system") can interact with its surroundings and exchange [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"). This exchange results in externally measurable [macroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale "Macroscopic scale") forces on the system's surroundings, which can cause [mechanical work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)"), to lift a weight, for example,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#cite_note-Kittel_and_Kroemer_1980-1) or cause changes in electromagnetic,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#cite_note-Guggenheim_1985-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#cite_note-Jackson_1975-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#cite_note-Konopinski_1981-4) or gravitational[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#cite_note-North_and_Erukhimova_2009-5) variables. The surroundings also can perform work on a thermodynamic system, which is measured by an opposite sign convention.

For thermodynamic work, appropriately chosen externally measured quantities are exactly matched by values of or contributions to changes in macroscopic internal [state variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_function "State function") of the system, which always occur in conjugate pairs, for example pressure and volume[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#cite_note-Kittel_and_Kroemer_1980-1) or magnetic flux density and magnetization.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)#cite_note-Jackson_1975-3)

In the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI), work is measured in [joules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule") (symbol J). The rate at which work is performed is [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)"), measured in joules per second, and denoted with the unit [watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") (W).
