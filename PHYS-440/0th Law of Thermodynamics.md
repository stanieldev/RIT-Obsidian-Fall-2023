### Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics  
 - Suggests Temperature is a well-defined physical property of a systemâ€™s state.
 - If two systems, A and B, are separately in equilibrium with a third system C, then they are also in equilibrium with one another.  
 - Two physical systems are in thermal equilibrium if no heat flows between them when they are connected by a path permeable to heat, i.e. they are at the same temperature.
