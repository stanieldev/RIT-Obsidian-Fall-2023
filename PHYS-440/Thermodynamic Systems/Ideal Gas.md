### Relationship between Temperature and Energy

 - Ideal Gas (no interactions other than elastic collision with wall) is an approximation.

 - Low-density gases are nearly ideal, and turn out to satisfy (experimentally observed) $PV = Nk_B T$

 - We can derive the relationship between Temperature (T) and Kinetic Energy (KE)

$$ \dfrac{3}{2}k_b T = \dfrac{1}{2}m v^2_{rms}$$
### Equipartition of Energy

For a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]] with $N$ particles, each with $f$ degrees of freedom, then the [[Internal Energy\|internal energy]] of the system is $U_{thermal} = \dfrac{f}{2} N k_b T = \dfrac{f}{2}PV$.
### What is an Ideal Gas
 - Molecules are identical
 - Molecules are tiny compared to their average separation (point masses)
 - Molecules do not interact with each other
 - Molecules obey Newton’s laws of motion, their motion is random  
 - Collisions between the molecules and the container walls are elastic.

### Microstates
$$\Omega = \dfrac{1}{N!}\dfrac{V_x V_p}{\hbar^3}$$
Where $V_x$ is volume in physical space and $V_p$ is volume in momentum space for $N$ indistinguishable particles in a box.
$$\Omega_N = \dfrac{1}{\hbar^3}\dfrac{1}{N!}V^N\cdot \dfrac{\pi^\tfrac{3N}{2}\sqrt{2mU}^{3N}}{\left(\tfrac{3N}{2}\right)!}$$

### Entropy of Ideal Gas
$$S(U,V,N) = N k_b \left[\dfrac{5}{2} + \log \dfrac{V}{N} + \dfrac{3}{2}\log\left(\dfrac{4\pi m (\tfrac{U}{N})}{3\hbar^2}\right)\right]$$


### Entropy of Mixing (of same gases)
$$\Delta S = (N_A+N_B) k_b \ln2$$
