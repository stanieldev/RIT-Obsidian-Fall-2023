In a [**closed system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system#Closed_system), no mass may be transferred in or out of the [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]] boundaries. 
The [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]] always contains the same amount of matter, but (sensible) [[heat]] and (boundary) [[Thermodynamic Work\|work]] can be exchanged across the boundary of the system.

Whether a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]] can exchange [[heat]], [[Thermodynamic Work\|work]], or both, is dependent on the property of its boundary.
 - Adiabatic boundary – Not allowing any [[heat]] exchange: A [thermally isolated system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermally_isolated_system "Thermally isolated system")
 - Rigid boundary – Not allowing exchange of [[Thermodynamic Work\|work]]: A [mechanically isolated system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanically_isolated_system)
