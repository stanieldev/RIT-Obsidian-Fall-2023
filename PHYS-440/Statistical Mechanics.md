### Core Principles underlying Statistical Mechanics
1. The laws of physics have to be maintained. Mostly this means that energy is conserved.
2. Systems tend to be in or evolve towards the most likely states
	1. This is the 2nd Law from a Stat Mech viewpoint.
3. $S = k_b \log\Omega$ definition of entropy, where $\Omega$ is the number of accessible states, and $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant.

### Statistical Mechanics
 - Gets into the details of the physics of specific systems and makes statistical predictions about what will happen.
 - Provides a much more complete picture, and is easier to understand.
 - But the mathematical analysis is more complicated. Founded by Maxwell, Boltzmann, Gibbs, others.

Statistical Physics: Provides a link between Microscopic and Macroscopic properties.

\text{Motion of Free Electrons} &\implies \text{Conductivity} \\
\text{Phonons} &\implies \text{Speed of Sound} \\
\text{Polymer Stretching} &\implies \text{Young's Modulus} \\
