In his 1991 Nobel Lecture, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes discusses the concept of "soft matter," which is often referred to as "complex fluids" in the United States. He highlights two key features of soft matter:

1. Complexity: Soft matter includes a wide range of materials, such as polymers, surfactants, liquid crystals, and colloidal grains. These materials are characterized by their complex structures and behavior.
2. Flexibility: De Gennes illustrates flexibility using examples of polymers and enzymes. He discusses the importance of spacer sequences in enzymes and how the choice of amino acids in these sequences affects their stability.

He goes on to describe various mechanical properties and phenomena of soft matter, including the coil-stretch transition in polymers under shear, the reduction of losses in turbulent flows by dilute coils (known as the Toms effect), and the behavior of surfactants in forming films and soap bubbles.

De Gennes also discusses surfactant bilayers and their flickering behavior, which is explained by considering curvature energies and viscous forces rather than surface tensions. He mentions the work on random surfaces and microemulsions, highlighting the connection between soft matter research and highbrow string theories.

The lecture touches on the field of liquid crystals, with mentions of Georges Friedel's contributions and the creation of new forms of matter, such as ferroelectric smectics and the "sponge phase" in microemulsions. De Gennes also discusses experiments with Janus grains, which have both polar and apolar sides, and their potential applications.

De Gennes emphasizes the simplicity of experimental approaches in soft matter research, drawing inspiration from Benjamin Franklin's experiments. He discusses experiments related to wetting of fibers, illustrating the existence of wetting films on fibers using small and large droplets.

Overall, the lecture provides an overview of the diverse and fascinating world of soft matter and highlights the simplicity and practicality of experiments in this field.
