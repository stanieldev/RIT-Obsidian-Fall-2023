In physics, [**Temperature**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature")is an intrinsic property of a system that expresses quantitatively the attribute of hotness or coldness, measured with a [thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer"). 
It reflects the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of the vibrating and colliding particles making up a substance, defined as the quantity obtained from the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]].
