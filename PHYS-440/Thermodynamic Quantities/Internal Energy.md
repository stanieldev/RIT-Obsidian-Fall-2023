The [**internal energy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy) of a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|thermodynamic system]] is the energy contained within it, measured as the quantity of energy necessary to bring the system from its standard internal state to its present internal state of interest.

### Definition
$$U = Q + W$$
- $Q$ is the [[Heat\|entropic energy]].
 - $W$ is the [[thermodynamic work]].

Note: This is a statement of the [[first law of thermodynamics]].
