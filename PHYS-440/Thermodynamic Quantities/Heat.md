In [[Thermodynamics\|thermodynamics]], [**heat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) is the spontaneous flow of energy between [[thermodynamic systems]] due to a [[temperature]] difference. In colloquial use, heat sometimes refers to thermal energy itself. Thermal energy is the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of vibrating and colliding atoms in a substance.
The [[SI unit]] of heat is a [[Joule (Unit)\|joule]] (J).

### Definition
