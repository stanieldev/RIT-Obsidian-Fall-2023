In Physics, [**degrees of freedom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)) are an independent physical property necessary to describe state of a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]], and paired with [equipartition of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem), to define [[internal energy]].
### Component Degrees of Freedom (3D)
.| Monatomic | Linear Molecule | Non-Linear Molecule
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Translational | 3 | 3 | 3
Rotational | 0 | 2 | 3
Vibrational | 0 | $2\cdot(3N-5)$ | $2\cdot(3N-6)$
N refers to the number of atoms in a molecule.
