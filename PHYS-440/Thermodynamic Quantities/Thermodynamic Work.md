In [[thermodynamics]], [**work**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)) is one of the principal processes by which a [[Thermodynamic Systems\|thermodynamic system]] can interact with its surroundings and exchange energy. This exchange results in externally measurable macroscopic forces on the [[Thermodynamic Systems\|system]]'s surroundings.

### Definition
$W = -\displaystyle\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P dV$
 - $P$ is the pressure.
 - $dV$ is the change in the volume.
