There are 3 kinds of **Statistical Ensembles**
 - [[Microcanonical Ensemble]]
 - [[Canonical Ensemble]]
 - [[Grand Canonical Ensemble]]

### Microcanonical Ensemble
 - [[Isolated System]], meaning constant [[Internal Energy\|energy]] and particle number.
 - The corresponding set of microstates form the microcanonical ensemble.
 - Constant N, V, and E.
$$\begin{align}
&\text{Entropy: }S = k_b\log\Omega \\
&\dfrac{1}{T} = \left(\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial U}\right)_{V,N} \ \ \ \ \ \dfrac{P}{T} = \left(\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{U,N}
\end{align}$$
### Canonical Ensemble
 - [[Closed System]], in [[thermal equilibrium]] in a reservoir of temperature $T$, with non-constant energy and constant particle number.
 - Constant N, V, and T.
$$\begin{align}
&\text{Helmholtz: }F = -k_bT\log Z \\
&S = -\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial T} \ \ \ \ \ P = -\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial V} \ \ \ \ \ \mu = \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial N}
\end{align}$$
Where Z is the [[partition function]] of the system.

### Grand Canonical Ensemble
 - [[Open System]], in [[thermal equilibrium]] and [[diffusive equilibrium]], with non-constant energy and particle number.
 - Constant $\mu$, V, and T.
