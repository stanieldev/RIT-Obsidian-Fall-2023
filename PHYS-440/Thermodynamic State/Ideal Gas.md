An [**ideal gas**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas) is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving [point particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle") that are not subject to [interparticle interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_force "Intermolecular force"), as well as being an [[isolated system]].

### The Ideal Gas Law
$$PV = Nk_bT$$
 - $P$ is the pressure of the gas.
 - $V$ is the volume of the gas.
 - $N$ is the number of particles in the gas.
 - $k_b$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]].
 - $T$ is the [[temperature]].

### Internal Energy
$$U = \dfrac{f}{2}N k_b T = N\cdot\dfrac{1}{2}m v^2_{\text{rms}}$$
 - $f$ is the number of [[degrees of freedom]].
 - $N$ is the number of particles in the gas.
 - $k_b$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]].
 - $T$ is the [[temperature]].
 - $m$ is the mass of an individual particle.
 - $v_\text{rms}$ is the root-mean squared velocity of the particles.

### 3D Particle Microstates
$$\Omega = \dfrac{1}{N!}\dfrac{V_x V_p}{\hbar^3}$$
 - $V_x$ is volume in physical space.
 - $V_p$ is volume in momentum space.
 - $N$ is the number of particles in the gas.
 - $\hbar$ is the [[reduced plancks constant]].
$$\Omega_N = \dfrac{1}{\hbar^{3N}}\dfrac{1}{N!}V^N\cdot \dfrac{\pi^\tfrac{3N}{2}\sqrt{2mU}^{3N}}{\left(\tfrac{3N}{2}\right)!}$$
### Entropy of Ideal Gas
$$S(U,V,N) = N k_b \left[\dfrac{5}{2} + \log \dfrac{V}{N} + \dfrac{3}{2}\log\left(\dfrac{4\pi m (\tfrac{U}{N})}{3\hbar^2}\right)\right]$$
