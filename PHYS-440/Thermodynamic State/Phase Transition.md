In thermodynamics, and other related fields, a [**phase transition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition) (or **phase change**) is the physical process of transition between one state of a medium and another. Typically, a Phase Transition is a big abrupt or sharp change in the properties of a substance as its environment (pressure, temperature, chemical potential, magnetic field, composition or ‘doping’) only changes by an infinitesimal amount. 

By means of the *Ehrenfest classification*, properties of phase transitions can be understood by examining behavior of the free energy, labelled by the lowest discontinuous derivative of free energy.

### Phase Diagram
 - The lines dividing different phases are called the coexistence curves.
 - Along these curves, the phases coexist in equilibrium, and the system is macroscopically inhomogeneous.
 - At the boundaries, the [[Gibbs free energy]] is equal for both phases.

#### First-Order Phase Transition
Transitions that involve [[Heat\|latent heat]], where a system absorbs or releases a fixed amount of energy per volume.
[[Temperature]] will stay constant as [[heat]] is added until it fully transitions from one state to another.
 - At the critical [[temperature]] $T_c$ :
	 - Volume, [[Enthalpy]], [[Entropy]], and $d\mu/dT$ changes discontinuously.
	 - The [[heat capacity]] at constant pressure, $C_p$ , becomes infinite as well.
	 - The [[Gibbs free energy]] and its derivative changes discontinuously
- Examples:
	- Freezing of Water into Ice.
	- Evaporation of Water into Steam.

#### Second-Order Phase Transition
Alternatively known as *continuous phase transitions*.
 - At the critical [[temperature]] $T_c$ :
	 - Volume, [[Enthalpy]], [[Entropy]], and $d\mu/dT$ changes continuously.
	 - $d^2\mu/dT^2$ changes discontinuously.
	 - The [[heat capacity]] at constant pressure, $C_p$ , is finite, but discontinuous.
	 - The [[Gibbs free energy]] and its derivative changes continuously
- Examples:
	- Paramagnetic $\rightarrow$ Ferromagnetic Transition.
	- Superconducting Transition.

### The Clausius-Clapeyron Relation
 - Along phase boundaries, the [[Gibbs free energy]] is equal.
 - $dG_1 = dG_2$ which leads to $\dfrac{dP}{dT} = \dfrac{S_1-S_2}{V_1-V_2}$.
 - [[Heat\|Latent heat]] is $L = T \Delta S$, so $\dfrac{dP}{dT} = \dfrac{L}{T \Delta V}$.

### Phase Transitions as a result of Symmetry Breaking
 - Liquid/Solid Transition : Broken rotational and translational symmetry.
 - Paramag/Ferromag Transition: Broken the full rotational symmetry.
 - Second Order transitions usually have a spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries.
