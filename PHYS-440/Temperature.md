[Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature")is an intrinsic property of a system that expresses quantitatively the attribute of hotness or coldness, measured with a [thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer"). 
It reflects the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of the vibrating and colliding particles making up a substance, defined as the quantity obtained from the [[Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics\|0th Law of Thermodynamics]].

Objects at higher [[Temperature\|temperature]] spontaneously gives up [[Heat\|heat]] to objects at lower [[Temperature\|temperature]] through the methods of [[Thermal Equilibrium\|equilibrium]].
