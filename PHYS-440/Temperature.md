TODO: [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature")


### What is Temperature?
 - An intrinsic property of two systems that are in thermal equilibrium i.e. thermal contact for much longer than a relaxation time.
 - Energy is exchanged to establish thermal equilibrium. Objects at higher temperature spontaneously give up heat to objects at lower temperature!
 - The 0th law measure of when things are in thermal equilibrium.
 - A measure of energy for the special case of an ideal gas.
### How do we measure Temperature
 - Thermometers. Measure temperature using substances that expand when hotter. 
 - Digital thermometers. Use thermo-resistive device; electrical resistance changes with change in temperature. 
 - Different materials (mercury vs metals) expand at different rates. Same approximate results if expansion is linear in temperature.
**What if we use a gas to measure temperature?**
 - Operationally, a gas can keep on shrinking as temperature is lowered. 
 - For an ideal gas, theoretically, at some temperature its volume (at constant pressure) or pressure (at constant vol) will approach zero! Absolute zero = the zero point of the absolute temperature scale!
