## Summary<hr>
#### What was the paper about?
 - The human brain is a product of evolution.
 - There are many ways that our brain could work, but biology selected one.
 - Our brain is mostly used for coordinated movement and responding to stimuli.
 - Our cortex responsible for social interaction is very large.
 - The brain does not like abstraction unless called upon.
 - The brain has 2 sides.
 - Our brain isn't the biggest, but it is relative to our bodies, at least relating to our intelligence.
#### What findings or big ideas resulted?
 - The evolution process modified what was already there, instead of working from scratch.
 - Utilizing a previous system for something new may not work out as well as expected
	 - Example : Reading using the ocular system (sight)
 - The oldest and most primitive responses are located inside the brain, while the outside is the newer and specific-to-human bits are localized.
 - The human brain and a digital computer are not identical in processing.
 - We're pattern-seeking creatures.
 - There are different kinds of memory.
 - The brain will attempt to predict the future.
 - There are at least 8 different learning systems classified.
	 - Episodic, Conceptual, Conditioning, Control, Reward-Based, Procedural, Observation, and Instruction memory are the ones listed.
 - The ability to learn is correlated with age, but you can always learn.

## Reflection & Integration<hr>
#### What from this article are you able to connect to your prior understanding?
A lot of the general biology information was already known to me, however the connection between it and learning was new to see, especially the more ancient part of us getting in the way of our more complex structure of modern life.
#### How did the ideas and methods in this article relate to other readings from the course?
N/A yet, but it's a great place for a foundation.
#### How do the concepts from this paper relate to the experiences of your or your classmates, especially learning physics?
I've found that a lot of this information wasn't immediately relevant to education, but the section about learning, adapting, and pattern-seeking did better explain the process of which people make their way to classes and life.
#### Does it help you understand your own learning better?
The way that I learn, while similar in a lot of aspect, seems to be quite different as I have the innate feeling to endlessly abstract, categorize, and organize all my thoughts. I assume this is why my memory is quite sharp on things I consider to be immediately relevant.
#### What key terms, concepts, or methods did you find most difficult to understand?
I don't seem to understand their section on concrete vs abstract thought. They claim that we're naturally built for concrete linear logic and that we have to go out of our way to abstract, but I've found this not to be the case in a lot of people I've met. Some never seem to grasp higher abstraction, while others seem to have picked up on it since their very early years.
It also covered the physical aspect of the brain's existence, but not really the human aspect of environment bar a small section about increased brainpower in our social region because of becoming social creatures. I did find the section about our intelligence being linked to our tools to be quite interesting though.


## Overall Feedback
on the concrete vs abstract issue, it isn't saying people don't get comfortable doing abstract thought. Through practice people learn to get comfortable doing all kinds of various things (writing, sewing, football). Abstract thought is similar. But our brains also do lots of powerful cognition almost effortlessly in the background that we aren't aware of, while abstract thought requires a deliberate focusing of the brain. For some people, that abstract thought becomes quite enjoyable and satisfying, and they do it much better than other people, but still it takes a deliberate focus. While things like walking and perceiving shapes and identifying objects just happens naturally.
