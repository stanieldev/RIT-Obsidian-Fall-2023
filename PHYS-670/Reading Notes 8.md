## Summary<hr>
#### What was the paper about?
Using active learning in the classroom, the challenges of implementation, and the various techniques of teaching against the traditional classroom status-quo.
#### What findings or big ideas resulted?
Active learning in and out of the classroom, in the laboratory, and with instruction based on research and evidence, leads to a increase of student understanding, engagement, and long-term memory on the subject.

## Statistics<hr>
#### What methods were used to collect and analyze data?
Not sure, I would have to read about the 4-year study done at the University of Illinois.
#### Who was the data collected from? In what setting?
The University of Illinois did a study over 4 years implementing a lot of what was covered in this chapter for introductory physics classes, and they saw an improvement in the understanding, engagement, and abilities, of students in those classes.
#### How were the results and conclusions connected to the data?
Since they were directly connected between the ideas mentioned in the previous paragraphs and the experiment done by UofI, the connection is implicit.
#### Was the link between data and conclusions clear?
As stated above, I think the conclusions from the theory and different techniques shows the direct impact of the new curricula of active learning styles on the students.

## Reflection & Integration<hr>
#### What from this article are you able to connect to your prior understanding?
Constructivist learning made a reappearance. The basis of the active learning covered in this chapter directly stemmed from the ideas outlined by Constructivist learning in previous things we had read.
#### How did the ideas and methods in this article relate to other readings from the course?
This chapter reinforced the notion that active learning has a marketable improvement on student learning over the traditional, lecture-based, teaching style.
#### How do the concepts from this paper relate to the experiences of your or your classmates, especially learning physics?
I found that I understood my classes a lot better when concepts in this chapter were put into practice in my classroom. For example, Electromagnetism with Dr. Ferrante, he used clicker-questions and the individual answer + discuss with peers approach, and I feel like I better understood afterward since I had to explain my reasoning and compare it between me and others.
#### Does it help you understand your own learning better?
I think it reinforced what I had already believed. When I was homeschool in grade 4-6, my mother had used the same concepts in my learning and I found that I was ahead of the traditional curriculum due to it.
#### What key terms, concepts, or methods did you find most difficult to understand?
Formative Assessment Classroom Techniques and the reformed Lab classes were a little difficult, and I think I'd need to have that covered in class. F.A.C.T. made sense to me, but I had a hard time writing down stuff about it and truly understanding the implications thereof.



RAW:
5.1) Active learning strategies have gained attention and support, but not adopted often even with evidence of effectiveness.

5.1.1)
 - The importance of constructivist learning.
 - Dissatisfaction with tradition led to deviation, named active learning, which moves away from passive notetaking and problem solving.
 - Evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs)
 - Research-based instructional strategies (RBIS)
 - Active learning requires a shift in classroom culture
 - "...comprehensive list of strategies and assessment tools is provided in the resource PhysPort, https://www.physport.org/"

5.1.2)
 - Discussion amongst peers is active learning
 - Peer Instruction where it's individual, then discussion amongst peers, to arrive to the final answer.
	 - Being able to explain your answer, I believe, leads to better understanding.
- Formative Assessment Classroom Techniques (FACTs)
	- I found this section confusing, so I'd like to cover this in class.
- Active learning can take longer.
- Active learning is still new and being observed.

5.1.3)
 - Laboratory classes being more engaging by using student problem solving?
	 - I find this section also relatively confusing.
 - Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE)
 - RealTime Physics (RTP)
 - Recitations can be made more active by using small-group activities and work that emphasizes conceptual understanding.
 - Active learning examples:
	 - Studio classrooms, 
	 - Workshop Physics
	 - SCALE-UP
 - Finance and logistics are challenges impeding the implementation of active learning in physics.

5.1.4)
 - Outside classroom is covered in this chapter.
 - Reading textbooks and homework are common.
 - Computer coaches from Chapter 4 are mentioned, but I have no reference for it.
 - Just-in-time Teaching (JiTT)
	 - Reminds me of Just in Time Compiling, which is what Javascript does.
 - The flipped classroom approach
	 - I think it's talking about learning outside of class and coming to class to reinforce the stuff they learned or to make sure understanding was complete.
 - Video-based materials are extremely useful in general.
	 - I use them all the time to be able to understand material the best I can.

5.1.5)
 - EBIPs and RBIS from earlier are mentioned to be used in a lot of physics classes.
 - Current use of RBIS exists, but they tend to be eventually abandoned because of the extra effort involved and time commitment.
 - Other reasons include students, cost, and support from their department.
 - University of Illinois improved student performance and perception using pre-lecture material, peer instruction, and other active learning techniques in introductory physics in STEM.

5.1.6) Continuation of 5.1.5
 - Widening Implementation and Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms (WIDER)
 - The section seems to talk about the implementation of WIDER with the University of Illinois, as well as the benefit and observations over the 4 years.

5.2)
 - Traditional, lecture-style, teaching, is ineffective for long-term understanding.
 - Just doing things is incomplete for understanding. EBIPs are necessary.
 - Assessments are integral for evaluating effectiveness of new systems and should be utilized for that purpose.
 - Institutional barriers are a major reason for non-implementation of new active learning systems.

5.3)
 - Peer discussion helps understanding of physics.
 - Implement co-op work. Group problem-solving efforts.
 - Change laboratories to be more about scientific practices over cook-books.
 - Adjust teaching in real-time with feedback from students.
 - Assessments are important for student learning and knowing where they are at.
