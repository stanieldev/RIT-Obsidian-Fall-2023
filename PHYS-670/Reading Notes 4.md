## Summary<hr>
#### What was the paper about?
 - The comparison between behaviorist and constructivist learning.
	 - That constructivist stems from behaviorist.
 - Behaviorist
	 - Breaking down complex topics into small sections, and reinforcing them one at at time.
	 - Useful for training, but not so much in physics
 - Constructivist
	 - Experience and observation leads to knowledge.
	 - Information that is different than prior understanding is usually resisted.
	 - Addressing and correcting student misconceptions is also part of this.
 - The comparison between conflict-resolution and knowledge-in-pieces approach.
	 - Conflict and resolution seems to work for a while, but eventually the student will revert back to the previous understanding.
 - Knowledge in Pieces
	 - Seems to stem from the idea of constructivism, as well as the sectioning like behaviorism.
	 - Misattribution is usually the cause of being incorrect.
	 - Helps to develop a "common sense" of physics.
 - Section 2.1.3
	 - Misapplication using a specific example.
 - Section 2.2
	 - Teaching by telling doesn't always work to combat misconception.
	 - Actively engaging seems to require students to better utilize their understanding.
	 - Contextual experiences help in combatting misapplication.
	 - It's more based on helping students create their understanding, rather than telling them the understanding they should have.
 - How to encourage good learning:
	- Good assessments
	- Active learning
	- Tutorials
	- Using previous intuition and analogies
#### What findings or big ideas resulted?
 - Utilizing Active Learning instead of passive learning.
 - Misconception using constructivism is usually from misattribution.
 - Misconceptions may persist if they challenge previous intuition.
 - Using the tools listed above to help students form their own intuition.

## Reflection & Integration<hr>
#### What from this article are you able to connect to your prior understanding?
Knowing how little we can store in our working memory would explain why breaking things down into smaller steps and taking them on one by one would be effective. If you have smaller things, you can hold it in memory and learn better than learning an entire complex system.

The usage of analogies are interesting since they try to utilize already observed patterns and generate new ones based off of previous intuition. This can explain why it can be hard to maintain correction with students if it's something they consider to be obvious and natural.
#### How did the ideas and methods in this article relate to other readings from the course?
It seemed to mention a lot of what I had already know, but broke it down in a way to elaborate it for those others who may not have understood. I found a few places to be a little confusing, but I tend to utilize a lot of what was written already in my own work.
#### How do the concepts from this paper relate to the experiences of your or your classmates, especially learning physics?
Using analogies and intuition by building it from the ground up has been immensely helpful in physics. I don't blindly apply a lot of things nowadays, unlike when I was in high school. I can successfully break down a large problem into smaller ones and use the intuition I learned here at RIT to complete things I may have not already known off the top of my head.
#### Does it help you understand your own learning better?
Absolutely! Seeing it written on paper what I had already experience from trial-and-error makes it a lot more concrete to me on what it is about.
#### What key terms, concepts, or methods did you find most difficult to understand?
I find the idea of some kinds of misconception to be a bit odd to me. I can't recall a time I had been corrected on something and had reverted back to my previous intuition unless I considered the explanation to be wrong, which was rare since most of the correcting was done by teachers and professors. Perhaps I have and I just haven't noticed, which is entirely possible.


### Overall Feedback
Your big idea that "misconceptions using constructivism is usually from misattribution" probably needs to be clarified. As the Knowledge in Pieces  reading that came next discusses, the P-Prims are mechanistic models that are useful in everyday life, and those often form some of our most robust naive reasoning patterns that can conflict with the formal physics reasoning. 
Correcting someone and then reverting back to and old idea may not be obvious to the learner because the "reverting back" usually happens in a new context. So the learner doesn't see the connection between new and old situations so clearly (because they are not an expert yet). Generally I would not expect the learner to be self-aware of reverting back to previous intuition.
