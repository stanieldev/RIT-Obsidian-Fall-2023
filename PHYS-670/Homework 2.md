### Background  
We received 12 student responses for the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA) and the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. A spreadsheet of anonymized results is posted on MyCourses so you can see which questions were easier or harder. The answer key is provided and the spreadsheet tallies up the total number of correct responses for each question. Several questions, especially on the BEMA, were hard.  
### Your assignment  
1. Look at the spreadsheet of FMCE results and the PDF of FMCE questions. Both are available on MyCourses->Content->Homework.
	1. Select 2 of the harder FMCE questions (at most 8 of 12 students were correct). There are several to choose from so feel free to select harder questions that look most interesting to you.  
2. In the same way, look at the spreadsheet of BEMA results and the PDF of BEMA questions. Both are available on MyCourses->Content->Homework.
	1. Select 2 of the harder BEMA questions (at most 6 of 12 students were correct). There are several to choose from so feel free to select harder questions that look most interesting to you.
	2. Donâ€™t pick the last 5 questions...people might have given up by then!  
3. For each of the 4 survey questions (2 BEMA, 2 FMCE)
	1. Write out a clear solution explaining the correct answer.
	2. Make a list of concepts that are required to answer this particular question.
	3. Explain why someone might have picked each of the wrong answers that were observed in our data. Is the mistake linked to a particular concept? Leverage ideas from readings and apply them.
	4. Was there any pattern in incorrect answers? Were some more common? Why might that be?
	5. Is there anything about the question that might have made it more difficult? (consider things like demands on working memory or other aspects of how the problem is set up).
