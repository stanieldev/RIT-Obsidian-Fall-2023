### Background
We received 12 student responses for the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA) and the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. A spreadsheet of anonymized results is posted on MyCourses so you can see which questions were easier or harder. The answer key is provided and the spreadsheet tallies up the total number of correct responses for each question. Several questions, especially on the BEMA, were hard.  

### FMCE Question #6
a) *Write out a clear solution explaining the correct answer.*
Given that the sled is slowing down at a steady rate and there's an acceleration to the right, the acceleration must be anti-parallel to the velocity and constant.

b) *Make a list of concepts that are required to answer this particular question.*
 - The relationship between velocity and acceleration.
 - How vectors directions correspond to physical directions (or not).
 - The relationship between acceleration and force.

c) *Explain why someone might have picked each of the wrong answers that were observed in our data. Is the mistake linked to a particular concept? Leverage ideas from readings and apply them.*
My best guess as to why only 2 students got the right answer of B, and an overwhelming 7 answered C, had to do with how the question was interpreted. Misattribution of steadily slowing down for velocity can sound like the acceleration slows as the velocity slows, since why would it need to slow it down just as much, right? Based off of general intuition of students, that answer may sound right, however since the velocity changes steadily, the real answer is that acceleration is constant.
After learning about how vectors can have physical intuition, it would make sense that the velocity and acceleration should look similar to each other, and so both will decrease. However, the acceleration's "physicality" doesn't match that with velocity. The acceleration vector isn't truly real, unlike velocity, and is more of a construct to solve the problem.

d) *Was there any pattern in incorrect answers? Were some more common? Why might that be?*
Significantly for answer C, which shows more about how a question may be worded has a more common effect than the content, perhaps. Some part of the question ticked the wrong boxes in students heads when they read it. This is all speculation, since I don't actually know why people didn't get this right, but it's very odd that a wrong answer was consistently picked, which leads me to guess there's something more here than randomness.

e) *Is there anything about the question that might have made it more difficult? (consider things like demands on working memory or other aspects of how the problem is set up).*
Probably an effect of working memory. To minimize space, redundant information is filtered out, but can sometimes overlap with things it shouldn't if untrained. If what I believe is happening here is true, then students misattribute the velocity slowing down as the acceleration decreasing over time since the velocity is decreasing, so acceleration is proportional to velocity. This just happens to be wrong in this situation, since if they look at a system with friction, they'll find their intuition to be very correct.


### FMCE Question #14
a) *Write out a clear solution explaining the correct answer.*
The velocity is constant, and so the force on it must be 0. Therefore the graph with the line always at zero is correct.

b) *Make a list of concepts that are required to answer this particular question.*
 - Graphical representation of physics
 - Relationship between velocity and acceleration
 - **Reading the diagram**

c) *Explain why someone might have picked each of the wrong answers that were observed in our data. Is the mistake linked to a particular concept? Leverage ideas from readings and apply them.*
I know exactly why the 2nd most common answer was A. Misreading the graph. I did the exact same thing when I started. This is a graph of Force vs. Time, not Velocity vs. Time.
Alternatively, if they thought the car had friction (which the question says to ignore) then a constant force to maintain acceleration would also be reasonable.
It feels like a main issue is storing all relevant information at once and being able to recall it.
Working memory is 100% to be at play here, as well as the brain taking shortcuts. If the question tells us about velocity, we implicitly seek out velocity in our answer because we had it come up recently.

d) *Was there any pattern in incorrect answers? Were some more common? Why might that be?*
A was the 2nd most common and the same mistake I had. It can be either attributed to misreading the Y-axis as velocity instead of acceleration, or neglecting to remember that the system has 0 friction.

e) *Is there anything about the question that might have made it more difficult? (consider things like demands on working memory or other aspects of how the problem is set up).*
Working memory and brain's shortcutting. A lot of the shortcuts are to protect our brain from overuse and instead rely on more abstract pattern recognition, leading to a very easy mistake.


### BEMA Question #12
a) *Write out a clear solution explaining the correct answer.*
The electric field inside of a bulb filament must be no-zero since there is a flow of electric charges, and so there must be a potential, and so must have an E-field.

b) *Make a list of concepts that are required to answer this particular question.*
 - Electric charges interacting with Electric Fields
 - Electric Current and Voltage
 - For the student who chose (A), Electric Fields with Metals.

c) *Explain why someone might have picked each of the wrong answers that were observed in our data. Is the mistake linked to a particular concept? Leverage ideas from readings and apply them.*
An overwhelming amount of students chose D, instead of E. The first half of their answer is completely correct, but their reasoning for the second half is wrong. I'm willing to bet that they followed, albeit more brief, a similar version of my deductions to my answer; flow implies voltage implies E-field. This chain of reasoning is correct, but the flow of charge is not the **cause** of the e-field and potential, but rather is reversed. Recalling this on the fly, one might wrongly conclude there's an E-field **because** there's a current, rather than that the E-field **causes** the current.

Another thing to note: Question D and E are deceptively close ideas, but I think that it's an excellent exercise to a student on the true *why* of electric circuits. The idea that one of them is a lot more fundamental and that just because A implies B doesn't mean it's always right to conclude that B implies A.

d) *Was there any pattern in incorrect answers? Were some more common? Why might that be?*
Consistently, students chose answer D, instead of answer E. Seems to be another shortcut in the brain, as they recall information they had from before.

e) *Is there anything about the question that might have made it more difficult? (consider things like demands on working memory or other aspects of how the problem is set up).*
From what I remember from UPII, I remember learning that there can only be a flow of charge where there is a potential difference, and therefore an electric field. However, in a case where I forgot all but the main gist of the relationship, it's a 50/50 shot in the dark unless we recall a seemingly unrelated topic (magnetism) to realize that flowing charge doesn't **cause** electric fields. Pattern-wise, seeing a current flow in the context of only really talking about electrostatics, it would make sense to believe that both statements of Flow causes E-field and E-field causes Flow are one in the same. It's about a reduction of irrelevant knowledge that ends up throwing out a crucial detail: Electric Fields exist without the flow of charge like in a vacuum.


### BEMA Question #6
a) *Write out a clear solution explaining the correct answer.*
The electric field must be pointing away from the electron's acceleration direction, and so must be pointing (D) down.

b) *Make a list of concepts that are required to answer this particular question.*
 - Knowledge of Electric and Magnetic Fields (You'll see why I mention B fields later)
 - Electric Charges and how they react to E-fields

c) *Explain why someone might have picked each of the wrong answers that were observed in our data. Is the mistake linked to a particular concept? Leverage ideas from readings and apply them.*
There are 2 categories of answers I noticed: Electric Fields and Magnetic Fields.

For those who recognized that this problem is an electric field, many had it pointed in the opposite direction. Why? Since the charge of the electron is negative, it flips the perceived electric field, which can be a small detail that can be overlooked with there is a lot of other information to be known.

Personally, why I got this wrong, was I misread the graph as a B-field, and 2 others did as well. This diagram is extremely common with magnetic fields since electrons follow a circle in a B-field, and the contour on the graph does look a lot like an arc segment. If one didn't actually read the question and ignored the blatant "Electric Field" in the question, the shortcut taken is that this is an Electron in a Magnetic Field question. Especially that these are common questions in an introductory E&M course.

d) *Was there any pattern in incorrect answers? Were some more common? Why might that be?*
Explained above. Summarized, one is incorrect about field lines and their effects on positive/negative charges, while the other misinterpreted the graph as a magnetic field instead of an electric field.

e) *Is there anything about the question that might have made it more difficult? (consider things like demands on working memory or other aspects of how the problem is set up).*
Working memory and pattern recognition all the way. If you can reduce the workload on your memory based on previous patterns, the brain will always take the shortcut unless you override it explicitly. In the case of the diagram, matching the pattern of magnetic fields and charged particles would take precedent if not paying attention.
However, for those who chose B, this more stems from how the electric field lines look as if they are physical vectors in space and so they point up because the electron is flowing with the E-field, despite that the negative charge actually inverts the direction of the true E-field.
