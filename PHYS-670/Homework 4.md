## Creating a concept map of our PER course

### Phase 1: individual small concept map (start in class Tuesday 11/30)
1. Read this article on the theory behind concept maps and how to make a good one:
	1. [https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps](https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps)  (whole article)
	2. [https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps#1-4](https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps#1-4)  (just the section on creating good maps)
2. Create account with Cmap Cloud for creating your concept map. 
	1. Use the Cmap Cloud to make your individual concept map
	2. [https://cmap.ihmc.us/cmap-cloud/](https://cmap.ihmc.us/cmap-cloud/) 
3. Make sure to
	1. Use the first 10-20 nodes.
	2. Create cross links between nodes as appropriate. Try to make the linking words brief, but precise. This is HARD work!
	3. Follow the guidelines in the above article.
	4. Test out using Cmap Cloud.
### Phase 2: Group concept Map (start in class Thursday 12/2)
1. Form a group of 2 or 3
2. Share a new Cmap Cloud
3. In groups of 3, develop your concept map. I recommend using Zoom or Discord screensharing while you work so everyone can see the map in progress. **Although the map is shared, only one person can be the active editor at a time.** 
	1. Identify places where a link is confusing or you are unsure. 
	2. You don’t need to use every node....the list below is just a suggested starting point. 
4. How did you integrate topics across the diverse units in the course? Were you able to make some links? For reference, the major units were
	1. Cognitive Science and Psychology Foundations
	2. Discipline-specific learning
	3. Psychosocial factors
	4. Situated learning
	5. Laboratory education
	6. Technology education
	7. Diversity and inclusion
	8. Feel free to make the concept map useful. If you find a good way to organize it, then run with that.
