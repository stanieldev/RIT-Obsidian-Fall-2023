### Timeline
1.  **Short Concept** (Due Friday 11/17). A 4-6 sentence summary of your idea. 
2. **Written rough draft** (Due Thursday 12/7). A 4-6 page _rough_ draft of your report.
3. **Oral presentation** (Due Thursday 12/14, 8 AM). You will present this during our final exam slot on Thursday 12/14 from 8-10:30 am  (Note we can shift the exam time later in the day if everyone agrees on a new time).
4. **Written report** (Due Thursday 12/14). Final version due at the end of the day.


### Paper Details
**Big idea: Select one or more readings and apply them to some innovation or reform. I want you to have fun applying concepts or ideas you found interesting to some physics education context you are excited about.**

**You will develop a written and oral version of your proposal.** 
- **Written** form: A 4-6 page paper 
- **Oral** presentation: A 10 minute presentation (with slides) + 5 minutes for discussion. 
- It is expected the content will be similar between oral and written. 

#### Criteria:
1. **Identify key ideas from the literature that you want to apply  (1+ page)**
	1. Provide clear definitions.
	2. Provide appropriate references. 
	3. The description should be thorough enough that someone not in this class could understand the basic ideas of what you are thinking about.
2. **Describe the educational situation where you want to apply this idea. (0.5+ page)**
	1. What “scale” is your concept? A single assignment/activity? A lesson within a course? A unit? A whole course? A program? An outreach event? Or something else?
	2. What student population would participate or benefit from this development? 
	3. What particular physics topic(s) or course would this impact? 
	4. Why would this situation benefit from the application of this idea?
3. **Propose innovation or reform in physics education (1.5+ pages)**
	1. In light of the ideas from the literature, what innovation or reform are you proposing? 
	2. Provide a rich description of your idea
		1. What are the goals? What outcomes? (Measurable/observable results)
			1. [Bloom’s Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/) Verbs are helpful ([example list of verbs](https://www.utica.edu/academic/Assessment/new/Blooms%20Taxonomy%20-%20Best.pdf))
		2. How does it employ the idea from the literature? 
		3. If appropriate, provide a schedule, lesson plan, or outline? 
		4. Provide examples. 
	3. After the reader finishes this section, they should have a good picture in your head of what you are planning and why it is innovative. 
4. **Propose assessment and research (1.5+ page)**
	1. What research question(s) could you ask related to your innovation or reform? These questions may relate to the goals for your project. 
	2. What data would you collect? (student work, interviews, observations, surveys, etc).  
	3. Within your chosen data collection method, describe what evidence you would be looking for. For example, if collecting student work, what  would the task be and how would you analyze it? If doing interviews, what task or questions would the participant be asked to do? 
	4. Who would your participants be? How many participants? (keep in mind not everyone who takes part as a student needs to be part of the research study)
	5. How would this research be useful in improving your educational plans or your understanding of how learning works?
