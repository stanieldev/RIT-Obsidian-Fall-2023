### Question 1: Bell States
In class, we learned about the four Bell states:
$$\begin{aligned}
\ket{\Phi^\pm} &= \dfrac{\ket{H_1H_2}\pm\ket{V_1V_2}}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\ket{\Psi^\pm} &= \dfrac{\ket{H_1V_2}\pm\ket{V_1H_2}}{\sqrt{2}} 
\end{aligned}$$

a) *Evaluate the inner product of $\ket{\Phi^-}$ with each of the four Bell states.*
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\Phi^+|\Phi^-\rangle &= 
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\Phi^-|\Phi^-\rangle &= 
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\Psi^+|\Phi^-\rangle &= 
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\Psi^-|\Phi^-\rangle &= 
\end{aligned}$$
b) *Do the Bell states form a complete basis for representing any two-qubit state? Why or why not?*

TODO

Interim) *Let pairs of photons prepared in the |œà%‚ü© state travel to two different people, Alice and Bob, who can independently measure the polarization of the photon they receive in the HV (like a Z analyzer) representation or the DA (like a X analyzer) representation. Recall that:*
$$\begin{aligned}
\ket{D} &= \dfrac{\ket{H}+\ket{V}}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\ket{A} &= \dfrac{\ket{H}-\ket{V}}{\sqrt{2}} 
\end{aligned}$$

c) *What is the probability Alice measures her photon to be horizontally polarized? What is the probability she measures her photon to be diagonally polarized?*

TODO

d) *If Alice measures her photon in the DA basis and gets the D outcome, what is the probability Bob will also get the D outcome if he makes the same type of measurement?*

### Question 2: Sacrifices we make for QKD
*Alice and Bob use a single-photon, polarization-based QKD system to securely share a random bit string (the key). Alice has a single photon source which can prepare a photon to be in either the |ùêª‚ü©, |ùëâ‚ü©, |ùê∑‚ü©, or |ùê¥‚ü© polarization states. For each photon, Alice chooses one of the four states and sends the photon to Bob through a fiber optic cable. Bob uses a half-waveplate and polarizing beam-splitter to choose to measure each arriving photon in the HV or DA basis and gets an outcome for each measurement*. 

a) *Draw a diagram/schematic of the setup described above.*
