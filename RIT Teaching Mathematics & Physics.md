### Stuff
Episodic Memory
 - Recalling an event in order, snapshots with feelings.
Correlative Memory
 - Association between information, conditioning, rewarding.
 - I do X, then Y. X happens, then Y.
Algorithmic / Procedural Memory
 - Learning through steps, writing, diagram, explanation, observation.
Conceptual Memory
 - Compilation of less-used memory that doesn't need to have exact descriptions.
 - X and Y share common info, define shared responses.
Propreotic Memory
 - Activation of sections to move and regulate the state of self.
