#RIT #PHYS-440 #TODO: Better Organize
### Topics we will cover
> Classic [[Thermodynamics]]
> Fundamentals ([[_Other items|Energy]], [[Entropy]], Interactions)
> Free Energy and its uses
> Classical Statistics: [[Boltzmann Distribution]]
> Quantum Statistics: [[Fermi]] and [[Bose-Einstein]] Distributions
> [[Phase Transitions]] and [[Critical Phenomena]]
### Connections to Other Fields
 - In [[Statistical Mechanics]] we learn how to sum over distributions of states. Very similar to [[Quantum Mechanics]].
 - [[Information Theory]] concerns how much information we can store, encode, and transmit; also built on the idea of entropy ([[Shannon Entropy]]). 
 - **Machine Learning**: ‘learning’ in ML is essentially statistical regression, and differences between ML models are often measured with a version of entropy.
 - Emergent properties in **Biology** can often be understood using Stat Mech; entropy production as measure of “livingness” or “activity”.
