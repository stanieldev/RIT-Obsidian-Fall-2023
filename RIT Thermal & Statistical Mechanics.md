#### Thermodynamics
Deals with [[Temperature]], [[Heat]], [[Work]], [[Entropy]], [[Energy]], etc, as rather abstract [[macroscopic]] concepts obeying certain rules or [[laws]].
It works, but it's hard to explain why without appealing to Statistical Physics.
#### Statistical Mechanics
Gets into the details of the physics of specific [[systems]] and makes statistical predictions about what will happen.
Provides a much more complete picture, and is easier to understand.
But the mathematical analysis is more complicated, as founded by Maxwell, Boltzmann, Gibbs, and others.
### Laws of Thermodynamics
0th Law: [[Concept of Temperature]]
1st Law: [[Energy Conservation]]
2nd Law: [[Concept of Entropy]]
3rd Law: [[Absolute Zero Temperature]]
### Core Principles of Underlying Statistical Mechanics
1. The laws of physics have to be maintained. Mostly this means that energy is conserved.
2. Systems tend to be in or evolve toward the most likely states (Second Law).
$S = k_b \log{\Omega}$ is the definition of [[entropy]], where $\Omega$ is the number of accessible states, and $k_b$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]].
### [[Information Theory]]
How much information can we store, encode, and transmit.
Also builds on the idea of entropy ([[Shannon Entropy]]).
### [[Quantum Mechanics]]
The sum of a distribution of states is very similar to quantum mechanics, and is the basis for most of the mathematics thereof.



$\dfrac{3}{2} k_b T = \dfrac{1}{2} m \bar{v^2}$
Where $k_b$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]].
